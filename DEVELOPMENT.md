# How to develop and run

## With docker
Make sure you have installed docker & docker compose. Then run
```shell
docker compose up
```
After the building you will see `index.js` in root. You can open index.html in browser and play.

Any changes in index.ts will be watched and compiled automatically while docker is up.
